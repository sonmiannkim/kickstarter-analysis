# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  **We've organized, sorted, filtered to narrow down our scope, and then we created visualizations and performed statistical computations.**

### Purpose
   <b> To help Louise's Fund raising company, we were given the previous fund raise data to  re-orgnize, sort, and chart to analyze the data to 
	the future fundraise to be sucessful by understanding the data</b>
	
	
## Analysis and Challenges
  <pre> Based on given data, cleaning the data was the key. There were over 4,000 rows and 17 columns presented. 
  Among those we separated and converted to make a consistant and a readable data which helped us creating 
  presentable chart.  While we were converting the data, we had a difficulties of understanding differnt timestamps 
  used in the column, but following the guidlines, we were able to convert the format more farmilar to us to understand.</pre>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	<pre> Analyzing the theater outcomes based on launch date showed Louise hghest sucessful fundraise were made in between 
	May and June and lower through September to March, therefore if Louise was recommended to focus on more on May or June 
	fundraise rather than the winter season through out the year.</pre>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	<pre>Analyzing the data based on goals clearly indicated that the goals around $45,000 were the most sucessful and 
	less failure compared to other goals  and she was recommended to set the goals  near the point where it was the most sucessful. </pre>

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  <li> Encourate to launch the campaine the warmer season, before the summer starts and not to encourage the cancelation of the plan those seasons and discourage to lauch the campaine during the colder seasons.</li>
  <li> Also failed rates are slightly higher during the success season, therefore Louise was recommended to anaylize successful cases to boost the compane productivities. </li>

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
<ul>
  <li> The most sucessful goals pointed when the goals were set to $45,000 to $49,999.</li>
  <li> The most failed goals pointed when the goals were less than $1000.</li>
</ul>
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
<ul>
  <li> The details of which compane was implemented the most on $45,000 range, Louise might consider implementing more of those catogories to campaine to be more sucessful. </li>
  <li> Details of success/failure campaine, such as categories information might give Louise which to plan more and which to plan less on those successful season we recommended. </li>
</ul>
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
<ul>
  <li> Goals made based on evey category success/failure rates.</li>
  <li> The sucessful rates pledged by countries and cotegories</li>
</ul>
